        <h2> A bit about me </h2>
        <div class="half-width">
          <p> I’ve made my home base in Providence, Rhode Island with my small growing family. My journey into tech started with a degree in journalism. As I started sharing my writing online, I was fascinated with how easily I could get my voice out there. I was hooked and wanted to learn how to build my own site to fit my own specific needs. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="half-width">
          <p> That curiosity then opened a door that could never be shut. When I learned how to build my first website, I realized I found something that gave me the freedom &amp; versatility I was looking for in my work. Now I’ve made a full switch to front-end development, where I can use my organization skills and eye for detail to write clean, elegant code. </p>

          <h3>Super structured HTML</h3>
          <p> My focus is writing clean, well-formatted, semantic HTML5 by hand to make sure that the content is easy to read, easy to collaborate, trouble-shoot and accessible. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="third-width">
          <img src="img/icon-css.png" alt="CSS icon"/>
          <h3>Tidy and awesome CSS</h3>
          <p> I pride myself on writing CSS that is easy to read and build on. I focus on keeping my CSS lean and fast to load, and I make it a habit to stay up to date on current best practices. </p>

          <h3>All kinds of image editing</h3>
          <p> Photoshop for the pros, GIMP for the opensourcers and a range of free and userfriendly tools for the broke tech newbies </p>
